          <h3 class="text-center"> Isotope Correction Tool</h3>
            <p> In the world of analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry, accurate quantification is crucial for obtaining reliable results. However, the presence of multiple isotopes for certain elements can introduce complexities that need to be accounted for. <br>
               Fortunately, there is a powerful solution to this challenge - the Isotope Correction Tool.
            <br>The Isotope Correction Tool is a cutting-edge software designed to correct raw abundances for the natural abundances of isotopes present in a sample. When performing mass spectrometry analysis, many elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each with its specific mass and abundance. Failure to account for these variations can lead to inaccurate quantification, hindering research and affecting data-driven decisions.
            <br> Traditional mass spectrometers typically report raw intensities without considering the contributions from different isotopes. This can lead to misinterpretations and potentially skewed results. The Isotope Correction Tool addresses this issue by utilizing a robust algorithm that accurately quantifies each isotope's contribution and applies corrections to the raw abundances.
            <br> Using the tool, an el-maven output file with raw abundances can be uploaded. The tracer purity must be provided and Dolly will return an excel file with the raw abundances corrected for the natural abundance and a seperate tab for the fractional contribution.

              <p>Introducing the cutting-edge Metabolite Library with different retention times for various platforms, a powerful resource for researchers seeking to unravel the complexities of metabolism.
                  Metabolite identification is a fundamental aspect of metabolomics research. One crucial characteristic for metabolite identification is the retention time, which refers to the time a metabolite takes to pass through a chromatography system. Retention times are influenced by the specific analytical platform used, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), or capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS).
              </p>In the past, metabolite libraries often focused on a single analytical platform, limiting their utility across different analytical techniques. However, the Metabolite Library with different retention times for various platforms addresses this limitation and revolutionizes metabolomics research.
              </p>
              <p>This library consists out of all the metabolites that the facility has measured containing information about retention times on all different platforms and methods</p>
